            &nbsp;Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi from Konohagakure. He received a
            Sharingan when he was
            younger, earning him the monikers Kakashi the Copy Ninja and Kakashi
            of the Sharingan. His prodigious talent, skills, and proficiency
            with the Sharingan made him one of the village's most capable
            ninjas, recognized throughout the ninja world. He ends up being
            appointed as the leader of Team Kakashi, where he uses his years of
            experience to train his students to become skilled ninjas in their
            own right.

            &nbsp;Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi from Konohagakure, a member of the
            Uzumaki clan, and the eponymous protagonist of the Naruto franchise.
            Since his birth, he became the Nine-Tails jinchuuriki, a fate that
            led him to be condemned and neglected by the entire village during
            his childhood. After joining Team 7, alongside Sakura Haruno and
            Sasuke Uchiha, under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake, Naruto worked
            hard to earn the village's respect and recognition, with the dream
            of becoming Hokage.

            &nbsp;Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are organized into a team after
            their graduation from the Academy in order to balance their talents:
            Naruto, the worst student in his class, would benefit from Sakura's
            intelligence and Sasuke's ninjutsu proficiency; Sakura would benefit
            from her teammates' combat abilities; Sasuke would benefit from
            learning to work as a team. Kakashi is chosen to train them, to keep
            an eye on Naruto, the Nine-Tails jinchuuriki, and to help Sasuke
            cope with his life after the Uchiha Clan Massacre.

            &nbsp;Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members of the
            Uchiha clan from Konohagakure. He became a shinobi so that he could
            someday become strong enough to seek revenge against his older
            brother, Itachi, who had massacred their entire clan. Initially a
            member of Konoha's Team Kakashi, Sasuke defected from the village to
            gain power under Orochimaru and later also joined Akatsuki, becoming
            an international criminal in the process. After the war, Sasuke decides to go back and help the village.

            complications of her teammates' lives. Training under the guidance
            of her mentor, Tsunade, she becomes a stronger kunoichi and an
            excellent medical ninja, capable of facing the challenges of a
            ninja's life as well as helping and protecting her friends and loved
            ones when they need her. After the war, Sakura marries Sasuke.
